# APInt Code Tournament → QA Jobs (Belgium/EU)

> If you enjoy the APInt Code Tournament and you’re curious about Quality Assurance (QA), this repository is for you!

The APInt Code Tournament is all about having fun by writing code that plays video games-and if you like that, you may already have the mindset and technical curiosity needed to work as a QA tester in either the video game industry or the broader software industry.

🎯 **Goal of this repository**
To provide useful links and resources for students who want to enter the Quality Assurance field, especially roles focused on **keystroke simulation**, **screen reading**, **game testing**, and general software QA.

## 🌍 Regional scope

I am a teacher in Belgium, so this list focuses on companies and opportunities **within Belgium and the wider EU**.
Companies outside the EU will not be listed here.

## 🏢 For Companies

If you are a company currently hiring QA testers-or you generally recruit for QA roles-feel free to open an Issue in this repository with your website or job listing.
I will add it when I have time.

If you know a company that *sometimes* hires QA testers, you can also submit it via an Issue. 😋
